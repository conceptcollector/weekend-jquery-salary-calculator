jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

Take employee information, calculate the employee's monthly salary based on annual salary as a baseline.
Return the total monthly salary for all entered employees.
When the monthly salary exceeds $20,000.00, the color scheme changes.
Employee information can be deleted out of the table and the color scheme will return to normal once the monthly salary drops below $20,000 again.
